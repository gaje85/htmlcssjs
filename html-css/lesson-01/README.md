## Introduction to HTML & CSS

As part of this module, we are primarily going to take a look at 2 very important pieces
of web application development - HTML & CSS

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
<br>
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets

HTML is one of the basic building blocks of the world wide web. It provides the fundamental structure to every web page 
out in the internet. CSS complements HTML by providing a means of describing the appearance of the elements built and laid out
by HTML.

The very first version of HTML, HTML 1.0 was released way back in 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee who released HTML
with 18 elements to begin with.

Overtime from 1995 to 2000, HTML 2.0 to HTML 4.01 were released.

Typically, these releases were managed & stewarded by the W3C - The World Wide Web Consortium - 
An organization responsible for standards related to the World Wide Web.

Development on HTML5 started in 2004 - under WHATWG - The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group - This is a competing
group that started work on HTML5 after it felt that development on HTML specification was not going in an appropriate direction under W3C.
Over time, WHATWG has gained legitimacy and WHATWG - W3C have come to an understanding that the HTML specification will be under the control of 
WHATWG, whereas the CSS specification (amongst other things) would be under the control of the W3C.

The first versions of HTML5 was released around 2008 and was considered complete by W3C in 2014. However, the WHATWG continues to work on
HTML5 spec on a regular basis and keeps updating it.

### HTML 5

HTML 5 introduced a number of new elements and tags with support with multi-media which was not seen before.
Some of the newer tags include
- `<nav></nav>`
- `<footer></footer>`
- `<audio>`
- `<video>`

It also brought in support for the Canvas API, Web Storage API, better File APIs


### CSS

Cascading Style Sheets or CSS, allows us to define the look and feel of a web document that is built with HTML.
It lets us specify the layout, fonts, color, margins, paddings of the various elements on a web page.
It allows us to have separation of concern between what the content is and how the content should be presented.

The CSS specifications are maintained by W3C - World Wide Web Consortium

CSS 1.0 was released in 1996, CSS 2.0 in 1998. CSS 3.0 drafts started from 1998 and have later broken down into various sub-modules in
which each have their own sub-specification and update cycle.

CSS 3.0 introduced a number of new features including
- Support for rem values
- Support for flexbox layouts
- Support for advanced animations and gradients
<br>
and many, many more.
