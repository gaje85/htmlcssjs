## CSS Layouts

In this module, we will take a look at the following:
- display property and various values and how it affects the elements
- positioning of elements via css properties 
- flexbox layout


First things first - the various css properties and their possible values, various techniques and options that we will see
in this lesson will allow us to take elements contained in a web page in a particular position/order and re-position them or
place them differently on the web page. 

Each option/technique has its own pros and cons; some web pages & their layouts might require a combination of the things 
we see here; there isn't one size fits all option available. Mastering these techniques will take time and effort and 
will happen over a period of time, so don't be discouraged if you find these options overwhelming to start with.

Start going through the files in the below order (with the python server running in your terminal for the same folder)
- 00_normal.html
- 01_floats.html
- 02_positioning.html
- 03_flexbox.html
