<!--
In this code snippet, we will take a look how we can position certain elements out of the normal layout flow and have
them behave differently. We will achieve this with the help of the position css property.

<!--
In our previous section we saw how float allows us to shift the position of certain elements from its default positions
and allows us to provide a different layout. Similarly, we can make use of the position css property to shift or reposition
certain elements from the regular normal layout flow.

static, relative, absolute, fixed are some of the various options we have available with this attribute.

we will have a specific set of elements with different position values applied to understand how they differ
-->

<!--
Static positioning - this basically the default behavior for an element. Nothing special or fancy about it.
-->

<div class="static-pos">
    <h1>Static positioning</h1>

    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Architecto dolorem eligendi excepturi ipsa iste laborum
        molestiae obcaecati sint sunt totam. Deserunt distinctio dolore minima modi molestias ratione tenetur vero, voluptate.</p>

    <p class="positioned">
        This behaves like any other block element and has been positioned static. Makes no major difference

    </p>

    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Atque dolorem magnam quo repellendus ut. Assumenda aut
        culpa debitis, hic illo ipsa iusto necessitatibus officia optio, sint suscipit unde veritatis vero!</p>

    <p>
        inline elements <span>like this one</span> and <span>this one</span> sit on the same line as one another, and
        adjacent text nodes, if there is space on the same line. Overflowing inline elements <span>wrap onto a new line
        if possible — like this one containing text</span>,
    </p>
</div>

<!--
Relative positioning - Its similar to static positioning except that once the elements have been positioned as usual in the normal layout
flow, we can modify the position with the help of other css properties like left, right, top, bottom. An element with position: relative but no other
left, right, top, bottom properties will appear as normal
-->

<div class="rel-pos">
    <h1>Relative positioning</h1>

    <p class="dummy-relative-pos">This element has been positioned relative but with no other properties set on it, hence
    it behaves like a statically positioned element</p>

    <!-- The top and left properties that are set will push the element 30px from the top and left of its original position in a static layout.
    -->
    <p class="relative-pos">
        This element has been positioned relative with a some values set for top and left properties.
    </p>

    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Atque dolorem magnam quo repellendus ut. Assumenda aut
        culpa debitis, hic illo ipsa iusto necessitatibus officia optio, sint suscipit unde veritatis vero!</p>

    <p>
        inline elements <span>like this one</span> and <span>this one</span> sit on the same line as one another, and
        adjacent text nodes, if there is space on the same line. Overflowing inline elements <span>wrap onto a new line
        if possible — like this one containing text</span>,
    </p>
</div>

<!--
Absolute positioning - here the element that is marked as position: absolute, will no longer be in the normal layout flow
and instead sits in its own layer separate from everything else. Now this element will be positioned in this layer with an offset
as determined by the combination of top/left/right/bottom css properties that are set on the element.

An absolutely positioned element is placed depending on the position property of the ancestor element. If there is no explicit position
property in any ancestor element, then that means they are all statically positioned. So in such cases, the element is placed relative to the
initial view port that is visible.

This behavior can be tweaked further by setting position:relative to any of the ancestor elements that contains this absolutely placed
element. These two points are key differentiators against fixed positioning.

-->
<!--
    comment/uncomment the style attr below to see the difference in behavior for the absolutely positioned element
-->
<div class="abs-pos" style="position:relative;">
    <h1>Absolute positioning</h1>

        cupiditate, facere iure nihil quae quia sit tempora ut veritatis. Dignissimos eum ex libero nam nisi!</p>

    <p class="absolute-pos">
        This element has been positioned absolute
    </p>

        inline elements <span>like this one</span> and <span>this one</span> sit on the same line as one another, and

        if possible — like this one containing text</span>,
    </p>
</div>

<!--
Fixed positioning - Its similar to absolute positioning in that the element is taken out of the normal layout flow but
then in this case it fixes the elements position relative to the visible view port on the basis of the top/left/bottom/right
properties
-->
<!-- Uncomment the below code and run to see where the fixed element is positioned
Scroll the page and see how the element always ends up getting fixed to one place on the view port. In absolute positioning, the element
would go out of the view when we start to scroll, but here it gets locked in.
