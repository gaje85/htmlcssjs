    In this module we will take a look at normal flow layout and block/inline elements behave in such cases.

<!--
    Lets take a quick look at the below block of html to understand what we mean by normal flow layout
-->
<div class="normal-layout">
    <h3>This is entire section is a normal layout</h3>
    <p>
        Here the elements are laid out one after the other. Just as they are placed in the HTML code.
        Elements that appear one after the other are <i>block</i> elements. Like the header tag and the paragraph tags.
        Elements that appear next to each other, like the text in a paragraph are all <i>inline</i> elements.
        <br>
        We have already seen about block & inline elements before. The point being these elements automatically enforce
        and provide this layout just like that. You dont have to do anything about it.
        <br>
        In most cases, like text displays or forms, this normal layout is the basic layout that you'd want (perhaps some
        styling tweaks at best). For more complex layout, you'll have to modify and adjust this normal layout with other
        options we will see below.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>First, the header tag is laid out</li>
        <li>Then the paragraph tag</li>
        <li>Finally its the unordered list</li>
        <li>Finished with another paragraph tag next</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The end!</p>
</div>

<!--  The thing with css is we can change when and how an element behaves block and inline
For example, the list below should ideally be one after the other like block elements, but due to the display: inline being set
on the li elements, its all next to each other
-->
<div class="normal-layout-mods">
    <p>here the list below should have been ordered one after the other in new lines but they are not because we changed the display property</p>
<ul>
    <li>first element</li>
    <li>second element</li>
    <li>third element</li>
</ul>
</div>
</body>
