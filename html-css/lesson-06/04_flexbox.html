Flex has a lot of css properties involved, so it might be over-whelming if we explore all of them.
To get our basics right - we will look at the following properties. You can study & apply the remaining flex properties as you
get more comfortable with flex and css in general. Some possible values for the properties below may have been omitted for
ease of learning. Always refer the official MDN guide for full list.

- display: flex;
- flex-direction: row/column;
- justify-content: flex-start/flex-end/center/space-between/space-around;
- align-items: stretch/flex-start/flex-end/center;
- flex-wrap: no-wrap/wrap;

Typically we apply flexbox layout in the following manner
- We would have a wrapper container or parent container
- We would have elements we want to layout in a specific manner contained within the wrapper container
- We apply the some flex properties on the parent element and some flex properties on the child element


Some terminology to be comfortable with (Refer flex_model.bmp in this folder)
- flex container  / flex item - Parent container and the children inside them
- Main axis - main axis start / main axis end - Its the axis in which the flex items
are being laid out. When the flex items are laid out on a row, then its the horizontal axis.
- Cross Axis - cross axis start / cross axis end - This axis is perpendicular to the axis of the main axis
