<!-- Form elements are basically various kinds of elements through which we can accept different kinds of inputs from a user -->

<!--
    Typically form elements are contained within a parent <form> tag.
    This is not necessary always, but a typical HTML form would have a <form> tag as the root of the form elements

    Forms can have single line text fields, multi-line text fields, dropdowns, buttons, checkboxes or radio buttons.
-->

<!-- A form element is what defines a form - its the basic container element for web forms
    it accepts to 2 attrs - action and method. We will see them in detail a little later
 -->
<form>
    <p>
        <!--   A label tag is a way for us to set a valid label for a form element. It tells the user what input or action
                they are expected to do for that field. The for attribute in the element is mapped to the id value of the field
                we intend to have as label
        -->
        <label for="email">Enter your email address</label>
        <!--
              This is a input element of type text meant for accepting single line input. By default, there are no limits on the length of the string
              given as input here. We define an id attr so that we can pair it as needed with the corresponding label tag.
              The name attr is necessary for when we do form submission, we will take a look at this in a later snippet.
              The value attr is current/default value of the field which we can set.

              Some attributes like type, name, id and value are common for a lot of form elements. Take a look at the docs online for more in-depth information.
         -->
        <input type="text" id="email" name="email" value="test@gmail.com">
    </p>
    <p>
        <label for="password">Enter your password</label>
        <!--  An input of type password is specifically for handling password fields. It will obfuscate the input that is entered   -->
        <input type="password" id="password" name="password">
    </p>
    <p>
        <label for="description">Enter a description</label>
        <!--
          A text area is a way to accept multi-line input. We set a valid id and name on it. It also accepts rows and cols attrs
          which are meant to tell how many lines of text and how many cols of chars in a row are to be displayed by default.
        -->
            <textarea id="description" name="user_desc" rows="3" cols="50"></textarea>
    </p>

    <p>
        <!--
            A button is a form element to display something which is clickable by the user for performing a particular action.
            The type attr is typically a button type which is generic button type. It can be used for almost all use cases.
            the type submit is typically used for telling the browser that the values from the form that the button is part of is to be submitted to
            a url on the basis of the attrs set on the form elements action and method. We will see more on this later.
         -->
        <button type="button">Submit Form</button>
    </p>
</form>

<form>
    <!-- An input type of hidden is basically a HTML element which is never visible to the user but is present in the form. It can
        be used to store values that you dont want the user to see or be made aware of.
    -->
    <input type="hidden" id="hidden_secret" name="secret" value="This is my secret">

    <!-- Checkboxes allow the user  to choose between multiple values how many ever they choose -->
    <p>Select fruits you like:</p>
    <p>
        <!-- Labels can be defined similar to any other input type   -->
        <label for="apples">Apples</label>
        <!--
            A checkbox typically has a type of checkbox. Amongst all the similarly grouped checkboxes, the  name attr is shared or
            rather the values are tied to one same name attribute. The value attribute holds what value you want that particular checkbox to have.

            If you wish, you can make a particular checkbox already selected with the help of the `checked` attr
         -->
        <input type="checkbox" id="apples" name="fruits" value="apples" checked>
    </p>
    <p>
        <label for="oranges">Oranges</label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="oranges" name="fruits" value="oranges">
    </p>
    <p>
        <label for="grapes">Grapes</label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="grapes" name="fruits" value="grapes">
    </p>

    <!--
        Radio buttons allow the user to pick only 1 value amongst a group of values.
    -->
    <p>Select your gender:</p>
    <p>
        <input type="radio" id="male_gender" name="gender" value="male_gender">
        <label for="male_gender">Male</label>
    </p>
    <p>
        <input type="radio" id="female_gender" name="gender" value="female_gender">
        <label for="female_gender">Female</label>

    <p>
        <input type="radio" id="other_gender" name="gender" value="other_gender">
        <label for="other_gender">Other</label>
    </p>

    <!--
        Dropdowns are another form element which we can use to let the user pick a value from a list while taking up too
        much space on the web page.

        For dropdowns, we use the <select> tag, a deviation from the usual input tags that we have seen so far.
     -->

    <p>
        <label for="fruit-bowl">Pick a fruit from the dropdown:</label>
        <!--  We apply an id and a name for the select tag. For the options to be shown in the dropdown, we use
              the aptly named <option> elements. One of the options can be auto selected with the `selected` attribute

              This has a similar outcome as the radio button, but it takes up much lesser space on a web form
        -->
        <select id="fruit-bowl" name="fruit-bowl">
            <option>Apples</option>
            <option selected>Oranges</option>
            <option>Grapes</option>
        </select>
