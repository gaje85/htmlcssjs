<!--
    Tables are one of the cleanest and straight forward ways of displaying tabular information.
    A typical HTML table consists of a grid of rows and columns. These tables may or may not have headings for them.
    Tables can be styled with CSS to make them more presentable and readable. However, we wont be dealing with much css.
    To make things simple, we will use a simple stylesheet already prepared for learning purposes.

    Note: An important thing to keep in mind is - tables are not meant to layout web pages, they are meant to display tabular info.
    In days past, when layouts were difficult to achieve with the HTML/CSS of the day, people used to force fit tables to achieve the necessary
    layouts that they had wanted. But that's a bad idea, as semantic a table is not meant for that. This is even more confusing people who read your
    web page with screen readers and other accessibility tools to whom the whole page would be read as a table without actually meaning that in any way.

<!-- A typical table will have a <table></table> tag at the start and end -->
<table>
    <!-- We then define a row in the table with the help of <tr></tr> tags  -->
    <tr>
        <!-- Each cell in a table is defined with the help of the <td></td> tags -->
        <td>I am your first cell</td>
        <td>I am your second cell</td>
        <td>I am your third cell</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>This is the first cell in the 2nd row</td>
        <td>This is the second cell</td>
        <td>This is the third cell</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<br><br>
<!-- Now lets build another table but this time with nice headers for each column. We can do that with the help of the <th></th> tag -->
<table>
    <!-- The headers are still a row and hence need a <tr></tr> tag around them  -->
    <tr>
        <!-- These are the actual headers defined for this table now with <th>   -->
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Places</th>
        <th>Animals</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Ramesh</td>
        <td>Chennai</td>
        <td>Dogs</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Suresh</td>
        <td>Bangalore</td>
        <td>Cats</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Mahesh</td>
        <td>Delhi</td>
        <td>Horses</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<!--  Sometimes, in tables we would want to merge a couple of cells and display them together. The cells maybe merged across
    rows or across columns. TO achieve this we can make use of 2 attributes: colspan and rowspan

    They can be applied on either the th or td tags of a table

<!-- Lets build a mock table where we see count of men and woman in various age categories-->
<table>
    <tr>
        <!-- You can have blank cells by defining a th or td and leaving it empty    -->
        <th></th>
        <!-- This table header cell will span across 2 columns hence has a colspan of 2   -->
        <th colspan="2">Age of 10-25</th>
        <th colspan="2">Age of 26-50</th>
        <th colspan="2">Age of 51-75</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <!-- This table cell will span across 2 rows hence has a rowpan of 2   -->
        <td rowspan="2">Gender Categories</td>
        <td>Men</td>
        <td>Women</td>
        <td>Men</td>
        <td>Women</td>
        <td>Men</td>
        <td>Women</td>

        <td>45</td>
