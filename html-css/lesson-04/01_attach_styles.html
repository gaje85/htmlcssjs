    <!--
        External stylesheets are one the most used ways of attaching styles to HTML.
        The value in the href attr can be a file in the same folder or a sub-folder or any such location.
        It can also be a remote server.
    -->

<!--    <link rel="preload" href="external-styles.css" as="style"/>-->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="external-styles.css" />

    <!--
        The style tag allows us to load internal stylesheets, meaning styles that are defined in the same file as
        the HTML.
        Convenient for when you dont want to load an external stylesheet or its not possible for any number of reasons.
        However, to reuse styles across multiple pages, you will have to copy the styles into each file.

        In the case, of an external stylesheet, simply linking the style via link tag is sufficient

    <style>
        p {
            background-color: #AEF;
            font-family: "Comic Sans MS", Arial, sans-serif;
            font-size: 14px;
        }
    </style>

    <!--
        Inline styles are where we declare some styles that are applicable only to that HTML element.
        Typically, we should avoid inline styles where possible.
        - its tough to maintain
        - making a style change for say the H1 tags on page (when there are more than 1 H1 tags), might entail a change across
        each of those tags individually

        Now what happens when there are multiple styles applied to a html element in multiple places?
        For example, the h1 tag here has styles defined inline and as well as in the external stylesheet
        the p tag has styles defined in the internal as well as external stylesheet.

        All this is dependent on 2 things: specificity and cascade. We will see about them in later lessons, but know for now
        that there is some rules present on the basis of which this works.
