<!--
  In this code snippet, we will take a look 2 general categories of elements in HTML
  - Block elements
  - Inline elements
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Inline & Block Elements</title>
</head>
<body>
<!--
    Block elements have the following characteristics
    - they start with a new line, meaning they have a line space before them always; they break from the regular flow of content
    - they take up the entire width of the available - its full wide left-to-right
    <p> & <div> are good examples of block elements
-->

<p style="background-color: lightblue; border: 1px solid red;">
    This tag is a block element. It takes up the entire width of the page for that line.
</p>

<!-- Similarly a div element is block level as well-->
<div style="background-color: lightblue; border: 1px solid red;">
    This div is also block element. It takes up the entire width of the page for that line.
</div>

<!--
    Inline elements have the following characteristics
    - does not start in a new line; they dont break from the regular flow of content
    - only take up space bounded by the tags of the element.

    Technically the specs say you should not declare a block element within an inline element, however, practically that doesnt cause an issue.
    Still its recommended not to that, and it'd be better as well, as browsers can potentially change the implementation in the future to match the spec
    and your html layout may break then

<p>
    In this big para of text, this <span style="background-color: lightcoral">span of text is alone inline</span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
