<!-- These are HTML Comments - you will find the files to have quite a few of them for explaining what the code does -->

<!-- Comments can either be single line -->

<!--
  Comments can also be multi-line.
  Use it as necessary.

You can simply place a line of text in a HTML file and it'll load up just fine! There wont be any issue at all.
HTML tends to be very forgiving

<!-- A typical HTML element/tag will have an opening tag, corresponding closing tag, and the actual content enclosed within the tags -->
<p>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</p>

<!--
There can also be some elements in HTML which dont have such open and closing tags, there are called
empty elements or standalone elements
-->
<input type="text"/>

<!--
    HTML elements can also have additional information which are typically not displayed in the content.
    They are called attributes. In the below example, the word type below is an attribute, more specifically the attribute name
    where the value within quotes is called attribute value

    Typically, attributes have a name followed by the `=` sign, followed by a value in a pair of single or double quotes.
    Mostly double quotes are preferred standards, but both will work fine.

<!--
    There can also be certain attributes for which the value is optional or dont have any values at all. They are called
    Boolean attributes.

    Typically boolean attributes take the same value as the name. Alternatively, they can be ignored as well
 -->

<input type="text" disabled="disabled">
<input type="text" disabled>

<!-- Tags are usually nested as well. Do make sure that the corresponding pairs of tags have been closed always, or
    there can be unintended consequences
-->

<!-- Another thing to keep in mind with HTML is newlines and white-spaces in the files are not honored when the HTML is rendered in the browser -->

<p>
    The quick brown fox jumps
    <!-- The new lines and white-spaces are ignored and the line renders normally -->

<!-- In HTMl <, >, ", ' are special characters that are part of the HTML syntax itself. If we need to use them in HTML content and not
 have them interpreted as part of the syntax, we do so via something called entity references.
 For example,
 < can be referred by &lt;
 > can be referred by &gt;
 " can be referred by &quot;
 ' can be referred by &apos;
