<!--
  In this code snippet, we will see various ways of displaying text content in a HTML page.
  There maybe limited comments here, as most of the code snippets are pretty self-explanatory
 -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Text in HTML</title>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- h1-h6 are heading tags meant to display headings. h1 is biggest to h6 the smallest -->
  <h1>Displaying text content in HTML</h1>
  <h2>Displaying text content in HTML</h2>
  <h3>Displaying text content in HTML</h3>
  <h4>Displaying text content in HTML</h4>
  <h5>Displaying text content in HTML</h5>
  <h6>Displaying text content in HTML</h6>

  <!--
    The above heading tags behave a certain way in terms of appearance. They also have another important role - they provide proper
    semantic meaning to the content they display. While we could have a div or span element styled with css to make it look like a H1 tag, but
    it wont have the same semantic meaning to something like say a screen reader which is reading the text and so on.
   -->

    <!--  p tags are meant to display a paragraph of text -->
    <p>
        This is paragraph. It can contain multiple lines inside of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is another paragraph. Typically 2 paragraph elements have sufficient space between them.
    </p>

    <!-- Next are lists - ordered lists <ol> and un-ordered lists <ul> -->
  <ul>
      <li>apple</li>
      <li>orange</li>
      <li>grapes</li>
      <li>banana</li>
  </ul>

  <ol>
      <li>apple</li>
      <li>orange</li>
      <li>grapes</li>
      <li>banana</li>
  </ol>

    <!-- In some cases, we may want the text to be displayed as a superscript or subscript   -->

    <p>This is a superscript example, X<sup>2</sup></p>
    <p>This is a subscript example, LOG<sub>10</sub></p>

    <!-- Text can be made bold and italicized -->

    <b>This text is bold</b>
    <i>This is now italicized</i>

    <!--
        br tag is meant to introduce a line break in html.
        Try commenting out the br tag and see what happens.
     -->
    <br>
    <!--
        Text can also be made strong and emphasized.
        While it looks similar in output to the <b> and <i> tags, the key difference is it has semantic meaning in HTML5,
        meaning it gives a strong message or an emphasized message to the content they wrap in for situations like screen readers and such.
    -->
    <strong>This text is made strong</strong>
    <em>This is now emphasized</em>
</body>
</html>
