<!--
    A typical HTML5 file has 4 major tags in them always
    - The doctype tag at the top of the file
    - The html tag
    - The head tag
    - The body tag
-->

<!--
    Pre HTML5, the doctype tag was used to tell the browser what set of rules were to be followed when parsing the HTML file
    But with HTML5, this has been simplified a lot.
    In modern browsers in the HTML5 world, this tag basically lets the browsers know whether to run in Standards mode or Quirks mode.
    We want standards mode as they sticks to standard HTML specification process. Quirks mode, is well quirky.

    For full list of quirky behavior, see here - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mozilla_quirks_mode_behavior
 -->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!--
    The HTML tag is the root element of a HTML page. It has no other parent.
    Every doc has one HTML tag and only one.

    It has the lang attribute which informs screen readers about the language of the page. Its not compulsory, but advisable.
 -->
<html lang="en">
<!--
    The head tag is also another element which is only one in a HTML page.
    Typically it contains things which are necessary to the page but not exactly displayed to the user. Things like stylesheets, styles,
    metadata information, title of page and so on are present here.
 -->
<head>
    <!-- We will see more details about the tag contents in subsequent code snippets. Refer 02_head.html in this module   -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Intro</title>
</head>
<!--
    The body tag contains all the content of the HTML page - the text, images, and everything else.
 -->
<body>
    <p>Hello world! Welcome to this training module</p>
