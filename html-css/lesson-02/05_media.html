<!--
    Images can be placed in a page via the HTML tag
    Typically you'd supply the url to the image - either a local file system path or a remote url via the src attribute
    The alt attribute is meant to provide an alternate text that is displayed if the image does not load up or if loading is delayed.
    It helps with screen readers for accessibility.
-->
<!--
The title attribute helps provide a hover text. Width/height modify the height of the displayed image. Not recommend to set width/height as it may
make the image look distorted
-->
<img src="indian-flag.png"
     alt="Indian Flag"
     title="This is the Indian flag"
     width="400"
     height="400"
