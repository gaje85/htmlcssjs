<!-- We will explore a little more in detail about things that happen in the head tag -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<!--
    There is a only one HEAD tag per HTML page. If head is not explicitly declared then most browsers will add one by default.
-->
<head>
    <!--
        meta tag  typically contains metadata about the page created. In this case, the charset attribute is being
        set to let the page know that all UTF-8 (unicode) characters are to supported. This should support all characters in the world in all languages
        This is also optional. But depending on your usecase, you may find its better to declare it.
    -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!--
        The meta tag can also have `name` and `content` attributes.
        The name would specify the type of meta element and the content would have the actual metadata content

        Below are 2 examples - the author and description of the page are defined via the meta tag. This info is used
        in a variety of ways - from basically telling the ownership details of the page, to CMS systems and for SEO purposes
    -->
    <meta name="author" content="John Doe">
    <meta name="description" content="This page is a quick tutorial for the header tag">
    <!--
        Homework - When we paste links from youtube or other sites into facebook posts or twitter - there appears a
        preview of the image or link there in facebook/twitter - how does this happen? Try to figure this out.
        Hint: Its related to the meta tag

    <!--
        The link tag helps link the current page with another external resource/file. Most common use cases are to load
        the favicon and the stylesheets of the page
     -->
    <!--
        Below loads a favicon which is what we see on the browser tabs or when a page is book marked.
        Typically the href refers to a .ico file in the root of the server
    -->
    <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico">

    <!--
        Below loads an external stylesheet. href attribute can point to a resource in the same server or an external url
    -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

    <!--
        script tags can also be present where they load external java script files.
        Typically when a script is attached in the head, it will stop the parsing of the html file, load the entire JS file,
        parse and run the JS file and then resume with subsequent lines in the HTML page. This is fine unless your JS code relies on the presense of certain
        HTML elements, in which case the script running will fail. To prevent this issue, a couple of years ago, we would load the script tags from the end of the body tag.
        This way the entire html file would have already been parsed and then we would load the JS code.

        However, with the introduction of the defer attribute, this problem is solved easier. The defer attribute will ensure that the
        JS script gets loaded without blocking the execution of the remaining HTML code. Once the HTML page elements in the body have been parsed fully, the JS is run.
        This way we dont face the issue of certain HTML elements not being present.

    -->
    <!-- Try running the same html file with and without the defer attribute removed and check the browser console for difference.    -->
    <script src="sample-script.js" defer></script>
    <!--
        The title tag is used to set the title of the page, used by browsers on the browser tabs and when the page is bookmarked.
