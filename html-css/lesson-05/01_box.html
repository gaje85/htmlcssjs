CSS Box model is a basically an imaginary box present around most elements and their contents.
It has various parts such as

Content box: The area where your content is displayed, which can be adjusted through properties like width and height.
Padding box: The padding sits around the content as white space; its size can be controlled using padding and related properties.
Border box: The border box wraps the content and any padding. Its size and style can be controlled using border properties
Margin box: The margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding and border as whitespace between this box and other elements. Its size can be controlled using margin and related properties.
