<!-- In this code snippet, we will take a look at code examples that explain to us how a browser
  decides when there are competing styles to be applied.

  So far, we have defined html elements, selected those html elements through various css selectors and applied
  a few styles on them via various means.

  However, if you've noticed before there were certain situations, a certain css rule that you defined for an element
  may not have taken effect. Typically, the issue arises, when there are 2 conflicting rules are applied to a css element
  and 1 of them takes effect (and not the other).
  The cascade & specificity mechanisms will determine which rules are applied when there is a conflict. Another related concept
  that we will try to understand is inheritance wherein an element will inherit certain CSS properties from its parent element,
  which may affect how the element finally looks and what css properties it has.

    lets take a quick look at what we are gonna learn better with the help of an example
    Take a look at the applied css in the external style sheet attached with this file

<!--
    quick example to explain how the cascade aspect of css works
-->

<div class="example-two">
    <h1>This is my heading for cascade test</h1>
</div>


<!--
    quick example to explain how specificity in css works
-->

<div class="example-three">
    <h3>This is another heading</h3>
    <h3 class="big">Heading with class of big</h3>
    <h3 class="dark">Heading with class of dark</h3>
