<!-- In this snippet below, we will take a look at how to use media queries.
The basic idea behind media queries is - we can have different styles applied for different viewport sizes and media types

Like for example, if the view port is lesser than 480px, apply a certain color to the text. Or set a smaller font-size.
Similar you can apply different styles for different media types like screen, print and so on.

Basic syntax of a media query is like below:

@media media-type and (media-feature-rule) {
  /* CSS rules go here */
}

- media-type to tell browser for what kind of media (print, screen, etc) the styles are for
- an expression that must be passed for the styles to be applied
- and the actual styles themselves
