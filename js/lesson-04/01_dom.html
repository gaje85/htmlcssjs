    <!--
        Web browsers have numerous global objects that are made available to the JS code. Most important ones are
        - window - The window object is a representation of the current browser window - granting access to various methods related
        the window under consideration
        - document - The document object which represents the actual HTML page loaded in the window in JS. Allows us to manipulate the
        HTML/CSS of the document, thereby affecting the document/page itself.

       So what is this DOM
       - DOM stands for Document Object Model - it is essentially a virtual representation of the rendered HTML page (including the HTML & CSS applied)
       - It provides a tree structure of the HTML page - making it easy to access from other programming languages
       - Since it is now easy access from a programming language like JS, we can easily manipulate it programmatically
       - Utility to see how the DOM looks like for a page - https://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer
       - DOM is made up of Nodes and the their attributes
            - Root node - basically the top most node of a tree - typically HTML for a HTML page
            - Parent node - a node which contains a 1 or more nodes inside it
            - Child node - a node which is directly or immediately within another node
            - Descendant node - a node that is anywhere within another node. A child node is a descendant node but a descendant node is not
            necessarily a child node.
            - Text node - A node containing string text
