## Pre-requisites

As part of this module, we will be primarily looking into JS code snippets.
This does not require a great deal of setup on your local machine to write a snippet and run it in your web browser locally.

However, in order to aid our learning better, it makes sense to have a some things sorted out before we get started on the coding aspect.

I have not provided explicit instructions on how to install things like code editors and web browsers. Its expected
that you can manage such things on your own with a simple google search. Always remember: Google is your best friend.

- A modern code editor which has good support for syntax highlighting and related plugins for web development.
    - While something as simple as Notepad will work as well, it makes life easier when we use a more specialized text editor.
    - I'd recommend Visual Studio Code for most folks. This is a free tool with practically unlimited plugins.
    - I prefer Jetbrains Webstorm - this is a paid tool. Pick whatever works for you best. There is no compulsion.
    - Install whichever code editor you want, but make sure to setup things like syntax highlighting for JavaScript via the plugins.
- A modern web browser such Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. Pick whichever works for you, for the most part the developer tools are the same. However
  there maybe certain aspects of the tools which maybe better in one browser over the other. From a learning standpoint, both browsers will work fine.
- Have git installed on your dev machine - this is optional. This is primarily so that you can clone/fork/download the code repo to your local and
  work on it at your convenience. Alternatively, you can simply download the repo via the download option on the Github UI.
- Have nodejs installed and running on your local machine - this is optional. While we can typically run code snippets in your browser,
this might be more convenient for others. You can download and install the nodejs runtime. Make sure its available on your terminal, setup any
environment variables or path variables as needed. 


### How to run the code snippets
- Open up the terminal or the command line app for your operating system.
- Navigate or change directory into the location where you have this project cloned or downloaded
- Each lesson folder is self-contained, so depending on which lesson you want to run, change directory into that folder on the command line
- Open your preferred browser - I recommend either Chrome or Firefox for maximum compatibility. Open a new tab and open the JS console of your browser.
- Copy and paste the code snippet into your console and run it to see it execute. In some cases, you may have to copy the entire JS file into the console, 
in other cases smaller snippets will suffice, use your judgement and go with what is needed for you to learn things better.
- You can also open up a terminal, run the command `node` to start a node interpreter and start copy/pasting the code snippets to see the output. Do what works best for your
learning process.
- While I have said copy/paste above, you can always type the code snippet in as needed to get a better understanding
